# 🧠 Mastering Sentiment Analysis: Build Your First AI Model

Welcome to your first hands-on journey into **Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**! This Google Colab notebook is designed for students and beginners who want to learn how to train their own AI models using real-world text data.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn
- How to preprocess and clean raw text data  
- Techniques for balancing datasets to improve model fairness  
- How to build and evaluate a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for sentiment classification  
- Hands-on experience with popular Python libraries: **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **ipywidgets**

## 🛠 Requirements
Before you begin, make sure to install the required libraries. Simply run the following cell at the top of the notebook:

```bash
!pip install pandas scikit-learn ipywidgets
## 📊 Dataset
We use a sample sentiment dataset with labeled text reviews (positive and negative). The dataset is cleaned, balanced, and used to train and test the machine learning model.

## 🧪 Model Overview
The notebook uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for sentiment prediction. This model is known for its strong performance on text classification tasks.

## 💡 Why This Notebook?
This improved version features:

- ✅ Better text preprocessing  
- ✅ A more balanced dataset for fair training  
- ✅ An SVM model with tuned parameters for improved accuracy

## 👨‍🏫 Author
Created  by Hernando Ivan Teddy for students learning the fundamentals of machine learning and NLP.
